It's the time of the year again: reviewing the past year as well as making a new list of new year's resolution. For me, things have been â€¦ "calmer" this year. Compared to 2019 and 2020, 2021 was still eventful but less dramatic and soul-stirring.

Inspired by this [blog post](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/on-success-meaning-and-time/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, I'd like to recap 2021 into 3 sessions with 3 of my most-listened songs, dissecting the correlation between the lyrics and what I feel about life during this past 365 days around the sun.&nbsp;

Solar Power by Lorde

There must be a reason why the title track of Lorde's new album, the song that radiates major summer energy was my actual most listened-to song on Spotify last year. Like a lot of people who appreciate outdoor activities and going out, the full lockdown during mid 2021 was pretty miserable for me. Not forgetting the stress and burden of continuous tests coupled with anxiety of cancelled practical classes to add onto that "physical confinement". This song harmonizes with my longing towards the great outdoors and my lowkey yearning to just pack my bags and leave everything. I never knew I'd miss the autonomy of being able to go wherever I want and meet whoever I wish so badly. I still remember the period of resentful complaints about the pandemic, the hopeful discussions of my supposed Borneo internships (which did not happen in the end) with my housemate and me sing-dancing to this song on repeat as solace. Luckily, we've came through. Things were more under controlled nearing the last quarter of the year which bestowed me sweet, sweet liberty.&nbsp;
