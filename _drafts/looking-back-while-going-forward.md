It's the time of the year again: reviewing the past year as well as making a new list of new year's resolution. For me, things have been â€¦ "calmer" this year. Compared to 2019 and 2020, 2021 was still eventful but less dramatic and soul-stirring.

Inspired by this [blog post](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/on-success-meaning-and-time/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, I'd like to recap 2021 into 3 sessions with 3 of my most-listened songs, dissecting the correlation between the lyrics and what I feel about life during this past full revolution around the Sun.&nbsp;

Solar Power by Lorde

The Same by Ashe

jealousy, jealousy by Olivia Rodrigo&nbsp;
