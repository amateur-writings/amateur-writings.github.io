At times, being human can be really overwhelming. Things don't go our way, unwelcomed thoughts came to stay, our minds might not even feel sane. In the past month, I have been experiencing intensified worries and fears about the future which undeniably crippled my ability to function as an emotionally healthy person and an aspiring writer on this platform.&nbsp;

Fortunately, on an agonizing evening drowning in anxiety, the inner rational adult in me decided that this has to stop. It was needed that I stop victimizing myself as the slave of my thoughts and finally take up the responsibility of&nbsp;*​​​​​​*trying to&nbsp;*feel & think better.&nbsp;*Emerging steadily out from this emotional rut, I'd like to share some of the thought processes and methods I learned along the way that were useful to reframe fears and worries.&nbsp;

> <u>Thoughts are just thoughts and thoughts could be altered.</u>

When encountering a certain pessimistic belief, this is one of the mantras I used frequently to remind myself about the dynamic between me and my thoughts.&nbsp;*Thoughts are not facts and should not hold power over me****.*&nbsp;**They are merely there for the sake of human instincts preparing us for any possible dangers, and they can be exaggerating at times. Producing false alarms, creating havoc in the mind.&nbsp;

Having this easily-recalled mantra as a fallback concept repositions me as the master of my thoughts and not vice versa. Our own negative beliefs about ourselves and the world around us could always be changed, and it is up to us to modify them.&nbsp; One of my favourite quotes from Shakespeare reads: "There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so."

> <u>Life is much more than just avoiding fears.</u>
