At times, being human can be really overwhelming. Things don't go our way, unwelcomed thoughts came to stay, our minds might not even feel sane. In the past month, I have been experiencing intensified worries and fears about the future which undeniably crippled my ability to function as an emotionally healthy person and an aspiring writer on this platform.&nbsp;

Fortunately, on an agonizing evening drowning in anxiety, the inner rational adult in me decided that this has to stop. It was needed that I stop victimizing myself as the salve of my thoughts and finally take up the responsibility of&nbsp;*​​​​​​*trying to&nbsp;*feel & think better.&nbsp;*Emerging steadily out from this emotional rut, I'd like to share some of the thought processes and methods I learned along the way that were useful to reframe fears and worries.&nbsp;

\- thoughts are just thoughts and thoughts could be altered

\- life is much more than just avoiding fears

\- meditation&nbsp;
