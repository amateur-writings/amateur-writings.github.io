<div class='g'>
<br>as if there's a mad bull&nbsp;<br>locked up in a cage with 12 bars&nbsp;<br>eager to be released&nbsp;<br>but she knows it shan't be seen&nbsp;

the bull came from no where&nbsp;<br>they thought it has long died&nbsp;<br>a scene a person an argument&nbsp;<br>bringing it back alive

human nature prevails<br>there's nothing she could do<br>the only hope for sanity<br>is for her to embrace the bull
