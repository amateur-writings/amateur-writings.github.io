Things happening in our lives might not be as good as we ought to be, but sometimes it is not as bad as we thought. Our jobs as mere human beings is just to face whatever life throws at us, with kindness, patience and courage.&nbsp;

Kindness<br>Remember whatever happens is&nbsp;*for*&nbsp;our growth, to help us become our better selves, a metamorphosis, one could say. Be kind to ourselves, for we may be hurt, scared and sulking, we could not let ourselves to beat us up when they do happen.&nbsp;

Patience<br>Remember that situations, emotions, adversities are not here to stay. Be patient even when they seem like it's never-ending. Be patient and understand that this too, shall pass.&nbsp;

Courage<br>Some days of living requires extra effort and fearlessness and we shall ask for that, from the bottom of our souls we shall discover, a version of us who will never be conquered by anxiety and fear.
