Raised in a pious Buddhist family, I surprised myself when I realised I've become more agnostic than I ever was. *"I don't think there's an afterlife, this vessel in this reality  is most likely all that I have"* was the statement I found myself proclaiming in the past one year in discussions about death and religion.

Death of a loved one has taught me more about religion than any other time. To reflect upon one's life and what's after that - one of the common times religion comes in.
