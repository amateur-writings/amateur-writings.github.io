Recently an Instagram post that shows a picture of a banner that goes: 'You're so in your head you can't even enjoy where you are.' intrigued me, leading to further contemplation.

The sentence perfectly captures what I am chronically experiencing. With frequent thoughts, envisionments, hopes and worries about the future, I just can't seem to fully experience moments in my present life. Minor mishaps may sometimes trigger loathing and longing: loathing the now, longing for change ahead. I feel like stagnant water, with trivial and unimportant matters and conversations piling up without being able to be drained out. I feel like the pendulum of a grandfather clock, with joy at one end and distress at the other, capricious thoughts swaying to and fro while time mercilessly ticking away.&nbsp;

Compared to my days as a 17 or 18, I realize time being jovial has become lesser and lesser. Are they eventually heading to an end?&nbsp;
