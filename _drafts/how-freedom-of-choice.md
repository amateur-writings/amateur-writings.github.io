Nothing feels better than having the power to choose because we, as mere flawed human beings like to be in control of literally everything. "The sky's the limit" "Anything is possible" are no doubt encouraging words to inspire people to work hard and dream big. The problem lies inâ€”having&nbsp;**too many**&nbsp;choices.&nbsp;

Life is essentially about making decisions every day, what time to wake up, which clothes to wear, who to meet etc. Trivial choices usually do not take up that much of our mental space but when we talk about choices that are pivotal in determining how our life might turn out to be, we can't help but mull over: "Is this the right choice?" "will I regret this in the future?". Perpetuating questions like these might cause us to never make a choice or even become unsatisfied with the final choice we go for.&nbsp;

We encounter what is called "analysis paralysis", which is the enemy of productivity and possibly, happiness. By not choosing, we shun possibilities of making the "wrong" choice. However, by not choosing, we stop ourselves from growing. By not choosing, we might lose great opportunities and end up with alternatives that are even more substandard.&nbsp;
