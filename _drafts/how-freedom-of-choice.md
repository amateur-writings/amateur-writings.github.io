Nothing feels better than having the power to choose because we, as mere flawed human beings like to be in control of literally everything. "The sky's the limit" "Anything is possible" are no doubt encouraging words to inspire people to work hard and dream big. The problem lies inâ€”having&nbsp;**too many**&nbsp;choices.&nbsp;

Life is essentially about making decisions every day, what time to wake up, which clothes to wear, who to meet etc. Trivial choices usually do not take up that much of our mental space but when we talk about choices that are pivotal in determining how our life might turn out to be, we can't help but think: "is this the right choice?" "will I regret this in the future?"&nbsp;
