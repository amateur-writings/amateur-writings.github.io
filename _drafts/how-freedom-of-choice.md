Life is essentially about making decisions every day, what time to wake up, which clothes to wear, who to meet etc. Trivial choices usually do not take up that much of our mental space but when we talk about choices that are pivotal in determining how our life might turn out to be, we can't help but mull over: "Is this the right choice?" "will I regret this in the future?". Perpetuating questions like these might cause us to never make a choice or even become unsatisfied with the final choice we go for.&nbsp;

We encounter what is called "analysis paralysis", which is the enemy of productivity and possibly, happiness. By not choosing, we shun possibilities of making the "wrong" choice. However, by not choosing, we stop ourselves from growing. By not choosing, we might lose great opportunities and end up with alternatives that are even more substandard.&nbsp;

Nothing feels better than having the power and freedom to choose because we, as mere flawed human beings like to be in control of literally everything. "The sky's the limit" "Anything is possible" are no doubt encouraging words to inspire people to work hard and dream big. The problem lies in—having too many choices. In his book, The Paradox of Choice, the American psychologist Barry Schwartz describes the bombardment of choices makes it harder and more arduous for us to decide which one is best.&nbsp;

(Add something here) Undoubtedly, I personally have been troubled with analysis paralysis and the paradox of choice, it isn't easy and I am still learning to tackle and overcome them when it happens. Here are some mental frameworks that I have found helpful to incorporate when we are debilitated by these challenges.&nbsp;

1\. Nova effect

This story of a dog (check out the video version [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGVhOWqsBWM){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}) tells us that there are no experiences that are inherently good or bad. An event that seems to be a positive one may turn bad and in converse, a negative experience might not be as awful as it seems for it may be a prelude to luck.&nbsp;

2\. Action before Perfection

Sometimes it's just wiser to go for&nbsp;*good enough*. Start with a good enough plan, a good enough draft, a good enough choice, then keep on improving from there. Not everyone can (maximize and satisfier)​
