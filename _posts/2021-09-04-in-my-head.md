Recently an Instagram post that shows a picture of a banner that goes: 'You're so in your head you can't even enjoy where you are.' intrigued me, leading to further contemplation.

The sentence perfectly captures what I am chronically experiencing. With frequent thoughts, envisionments, hopes and worries about the future, I just can't seem to fully experience moments in my present life. Minor mishaps may sometimes trigger loathing and longing: loathing the now, longing for a change ahead. I feel like stagnant water, with trivial and unimportant matters and conversations piling up without being able to be drained out. I feel like the pendulum of a grandfather clock, with joy at one end and distress at the other, capricious thoughts swaying to and fro while time mercilessly ticking away.&nbsp;

Life is only realized in hindsight, which made me hope to get a glimpse of what I'd be feeling when I'm old and frail, hoping to obtain an improbable certainty of life's plan. "Whether I'll end up on a different continent? Will I change careers? Who will I settle down with?" are futile thoughts that pollute the working mind.&nbsp;

The only escape is to face, however daunting it may be. &nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;
