Having a daily plate of good and nutritious food might not be something special or worth celebrating for the financially stable but it would be the greatest dream for the poor. When things are the same every day, we wouldn't realize how things could be so different; the norm we are accustomed to is actually a blessing, but we're too habituated to notice. The same goes for happiness: if all the bad days in your life are wiped out from your memory, it's inevitable that the degree of happiness during your good days will not be as pronounced.

The two ends of a polar form a line, while having no two opposite ends would make it a dot. I'd like to think of life as an ECG, where ups and downs would make it interesting, signifying a person is living. Conversely, having a same dot extending across time forms a monotonous line: dull and lifeless.

I once wished to be emotionless. How nice it would be to spare myself from dreadful pain and suffering this world seems to never run out of, I won't be sad ever again. But at what cost? I would not be able to experience the cliche thing everyone preaches about which is called: love, or the warm, fuzzy feeling when someone holds my hand, or the way I'll be feeling like the main character of a story when the evening sun glows on my face after a great day.

You cannot have good days without the bad ones, just like how you cannot only choose the good parts of a person to be with, you'll be dealing and embracing the bad parts too. Subpar days serve as a reminder to always enjoy the moments of calm and content, ecstasy and elation. Everything is constantly fleeting, we shouldn't take bad days too personally too as they will pass by soon.

Only when there's rain, you'd notice how pleasant it is to have sunny days.
