            <p>Wikipedia defines hope as "an optimistic state of mind that is based on an expectation of positive outcomes with respect to events and circumstances in one's life or the world at large". It's really interesting to know that only humans are able to hope, to anticipate that things will be better in the future, aiding in relieving unpleasant feelings that may be tied to the present. </p><blockquote>“Hope is a match in a dark tunnel, a moment of light, just enough to reveal the path ahead and ultimately the way out.” &nbsp;-Dr. Judith Rich</blockquote><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<!--kg-card-end: html--><p>I do agree that hope plays a vital role in our day to day lives, even if you don't notice it. Whether it's working hard to earn a promotion, receiving treatments for a disease or being a good child to get the best Christmas gift, they all entail hope. Hope drives us to be the more ideal versions of ourselves, grants us a little spark even when things seem gloomy, and reminds us that no matter how awful the current situation may be, it can change for the better.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2014/11/hope" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">study</a> published by The American Psychology Association proposed that <strong>hope</strong> was the common denominator for children that suffered from poverty but were able to thrive later on in life. Other studies (eg: <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1448867?seq=1">this</a> &amp; <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-6494.2006.00432.x">this</a>) have also revealed tons of benefits of having hope in our lives. &nbsp;</p><p>But what if we lose hope? Hopelessness can be related to many behavioural and mental health issues like depression and suicidal ideation. It could be potentially dangerous as we do not look forward to the future and feel like everything we do will not amount to anything. If you do experience hopelessness, seeking help is the way to go :) Maybe you could start <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/pieces-mind/201504/finding-hope">here</a>.</p><p>I'll end this with a quote that I think is somewhat profound and largely true, at least for me. </p><blockquote>“They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for.” -American author Tom Bodett</blockquote>
