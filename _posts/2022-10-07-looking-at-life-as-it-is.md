Things happening in our lives might not be as good as we ought to be, but sometimes it is not as bad as we thought. Our job as mere human beings is just to face whatever life throws at us, with kindness, patience and courage.&nbsp;

**Kindness**

Remember whatever happens is *for* our growth, to help us become our better selves, a metamorphosis, one could say. Be kind to ourselves, for we may be hurt, scared and sulking, we could not let us beat ourselves up when they do happen.&nbsp;

**Patience**

Remember that situations, emotions, and adversities are not here to stay. Be patient even when they seem never-ending. Be patient and understand that this too, shall pass.&nbsp;

**Courage**

Some days of living require extra effort and fearlessness and we shall ask for that â€”from the bottom of our souls we will discover, a version of us who will never be conquered by anxiety or fear.
