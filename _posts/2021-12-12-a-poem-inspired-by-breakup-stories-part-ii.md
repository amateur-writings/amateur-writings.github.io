<div class="poem">
It is painful<br><br>

To realize carefree conversations<br>
Are now walks on eggshells<br>
It was the start of death<br>
Where love is ready to bid farewell<br><br>

There were shouts on the phone<br>
Where shoulders turned cold<br>
Apologies untold on nights alone<br><br>

It is painful<br><br>

With you still appearing in my dreams<br>
Poignant rather than euphoric<br>
It reminds me how things could've been<br>
Before it all went over the brim<br><br>

Iâ€™m sorry I was the one who said it<br>
None of another she<br>
The one you ought to seek, is not me<br>
