There are a few reasons to why I’m starting this:

1. I want to hone my English writing skills while learning new stuff in a constructionist way.

2. This could be acting as a ‘serendipity vehicle’ (am a fan of Ali Abdaal, came across this idea in his videos hence I’m doing this now)

3. Apart from YouTube videos, I want to have another “project” to work on weekly and I really do hope I could persist in writing every week.

Pardon me, this first blog post will be more of a personal one.

This past year has been crazy, moved to a new apartment, continuing on online classes, picking up new things to learn, plans were put off, maintaining friendships and a long-distance relationship amidst everything. However, I still feel like I’m being too comfortable, parts of me are yearning to do scary and daunting things, forcing me to learn in hopes to reach a certain breakthrough. That is why now is the perfect time for me to start a YouTube channel and a blog, where I would document my process of learning. Though I won’t be literally posting about how I film my videos or write my blogs, it’s more like, 6 months or 1 year in, I would have all these so-called products that represent how much I’ve grown as a content creator/ writer/ information sharer?

One particular concept has been really helpful these days as I’m starting out, which is: the Beginner’s Mindset. Apparently, it’s originated from Zen Buddhism known as shosin, came across it in a YouTube video from Sam Lui that talks about feeling lost in his 20s. A similar concept (amateur’s spirit) is written in the book: Show your Work! (an enjoyable read, highly recommend)

Because they have little to lose, amateurs are willing to try anything and share the results. They take chances, experiment, and follow their whims. Sometimes, in the process of doing things in an unprofessional way, they make new discoveries. The real gap is between doing nothing and doing something.
I’m willing to learn, to accept failures, to persist (even if it becomes a mundane task one day), no one might be reading, but I will be here.
